"""Generate git blobs directly from RCS files.

Usage: generate_blobs.py BLOBFILE

To standard input should be written a series of pickles, each of which
contains the following tuple:

(RCSFILE, {CVS_REV : MARK, ...})

indicating which RCS file to read, which CVS revisions should be
written to the blob file, and which marks to give each of the blobs.

Since the tuples are read from stdin, either the calling program has
to write to this program's stdin in binary mode and ensure that this
program's standard input is opened in binary mode (e.g., using
Python's '-u' option) or both can be in text mode *provided* that
pickle protocol 0 is used.

The program does most of its work in RAM, keeping at most one revision
fulltext and one revision deltatext (plus perhaps one or two copies as
scratch space) in memory at a time.  But there are times when the
fulltext of a revision is needed multiple times, for example when
multiple branches sprout from the revision.  In these cases, the
fulltext is written to disk.  If the fulltext is also needed for the
blobfile, then the copy in the blobfils is read again when it is
needed.  If the fulltext is not needed in the blobfile, then it is
written to a temporary file created with Python's tempfile module."""
